# Changelog

All notable changes to Phorge. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
the project is pre-1.0 and unpublished, so versions track milestone progress, not a release
cadence. Milestones and their status live in `docs/MILESTONES.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### M2 P4c — Methods + `this` on the VM (2026-06-16) — **M2 P4 complete**
Brings instance methods and `this` to the bytecode VM. With this, **`runvm` covers the full M1
language surface** and `examples/grades.phg` runs on both backends. See
`docs/plans/2026-06-16-m2-p4-classes-enums-match.md`.

- **Added**
  - `Op::CallMethod(name_idx, argc)` — runtime method dispatch off the receiver instance's class,
    via a program-level `(class, method) → function index` table; the frame opens with the
    receiver at slot 0 (`this`).
  - Methods compile to functions (receiver at slot 0, params at `1..=argc`); `this` and bare field
    reads inside a method/ctor body resolve against the receiver.
  - `examples/grades.phg` joined the differential examples sweep; `phorge bench examples/grades.phg`
    runs (VM ≈3.2× the tree-walker on it).
- **Removed**
  - The last two `(M2 P4)` compile-error stubs (`Expr::This`, method calls) — `grep "M2 P4"` in
    `compiler.rs`/`vm.rs` is now clean.
- **Parity notes**
  - Method existence is checker-enforced, so the VM's method-not-found fault is a defensive
    backstop (no `agree_err` case, like P4a's exhaustiveness).
  - `num_ty` now classifies a `this.field`/bare-field arithmetic operand (via the class's field
    tags). A field read on an *arbitrary* instance or a `List` element remains the coarse-`TyTag`
    gap (deferred to Wave 4); not exercised by the corpus.

### M2 P4b — Classes on the VM (2026-06-16)
Brings class construction (with constructor promotion + body side effects) and field reads to the
bytecode VM. See `docs/plans/2026-06-16-m2-p4-classes-enums-match.md`.

- **Added**
  - `Op::MakeInstance` (build a `Value::Instance` from promoted-field values) and `Op::GetField`
    (runtime field lookup, with a `no field` fault byte-identical to the interpreter).
  - A program-level `ClassDesc` table (per-class promoted-field names) and an interned
    field-name pool, both validated by `BytecodeProgram::validate`.
  - Each constructor compiles to a synthetic `<Class>::new` function: it promotes its params into
    fields via `MakeInstance`, runs the body for side effects with the instance in scope, and
    returns the instance. `ClassName(args)` resolves to a `Call` into it.
- **Object model**
  - Instances are value-native: the VM reuses the shared `Value::Instance`, clone-on-use,
    mirroring the interpreter (decision P4-1). No arena.
- **Parity notes**
  - A ctor body's `return` is discarded and the promoted instance is always returned (interpreter
    parity): the synthetic ctor redirects body `return`s to an epilogue that loads + returns the
    instance, so an early `return;` cannot change the result.
  - Reading an explicit (uninitialized) `Field` member type-checks but faults `no field` at
    runtime on **both** backends — construction populates only promoted ctor params.
- **Known limitation (pre-existing coarse-type gap, deferred to Wave 4)**
  - A field read used as the *direct left operand* of arithmetic (`p.x + …`) can't be classified
    by the compiler's coarse `TyTag` (it can't recover field types yet — same gap as `Index`).
    Field reads work everywhere else: interpolation, equality, call arguments, arithmetic
    right-operand, or bound through a typed local first.
  - `examples/grades.phg` still needs P4c (it calls an instance method).

### M2 P4a — Enums + `match` on the VM (2026-06-16)
Brings single-payload enums and exhaustive `match` to the bytecode VM (already in the
interpreter since M1). See `docs/plans/2026-06-16-m2-p4-classes-enums-match.md`.

- **Added**
  - `Op::MakeEnum`/`MatchTag`/`GetEnumField` (enum construction, variant tag test, payload
    extraction) + `Op::MatchFail` (checker-unreachable non-exhaustive backstop, byte-identical
    to the interpreter's fault).
  - A program-level `EnumDesc` table (the enum analogue of the constant pool), validated by
    `BytecodeProgram::validate`.
  - Compiler operand-height tracking, so a `match` used mid-expression (e.g. as a binary
    operand, or nested in another arm) spills its scrutinee to the correct stack slot.
- **Object model**
  - Enums are value-native: the VM reuses the shared `Value::Enum`, clone-on-use, mirroring the
    interpreter (decision P4-1). No arena — deferred to a bench-gated perf milestone.
- **Known limitation (pre-existing, shared by both backends)**
  - `match` cannot appear inside string interpolation — the lexer's `{…}` interpolation does not
    nest a `match`'s braces. Not a parity issue (both backends reject it identically).

### M2 P3.5 — Hardening (in progress, 2026-06-16)
Closing the parity/no-crash contract gaps before P4 widens the surface. See
`docs/plans/2026-06-16-m2-p3.5-hardening-roadmap.md`.

- **Added**
  - `phorge bench <file>` — median-of-N timing of both backends, output-identity gated; measures
    the "VM faster than tree-walker" thesis (≈10× on `examples/fib.phg`) instead of asserting it.
  - `agree_err` error-parity oracle in the differential harness (faults classified by semantic
    `FaultKind`).
  - Central `src/limits.rs` (recursion/nesting caps + numeric-width policy); unified
    `diagnostic::Diagnostic` for all stages; `BytecodeProgram::validate`; `docs/INVARIANTS.md`,
    `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- **Changed**
  - Arithmetic/comparison single-sourced into `value.rs` (both backends call the same kernels).
  - VM runtime errors now carry the source line (`Chunk.lines`).
  - Constant pool interns scalar duplicates.
  - `interpreter::Frame` → `CallScopes` (removes the name collision with `vm::Frame`); scope-verbs
    unified (`push_scope`/`pop_scope`).
  - Quality gate is now compile-time (`warnings = "deny"`, `clippy.all = "deny"`,
    `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`) + a tracked pre-commit hook.
- **Fixed**
  - `Op::Neg` on `i64::MIN` aborted the VM (P0) — now a clean `integer overflow` fault, matching
    the interpreter.
  - Interpreter/parser/checker no longer SIGABRT on deep recursion/nesting — explicit limits fault
    cleanly.
  - Determinism: checker's non-exhaustive-`match` error sorts its missing-variant list.

## M2 — Bytecode + VM (P1–P3, 2026-06-16)
- **P1** — `Chunk` + typed `Op` enum + stack VM dispatch loop.
- **P2** — AST→bytecode compiler for the `main`-only surface + `phorge runvm` + the differential
  harness (`runvm` byte-identical to `run`).
- **P3** — user function calls, clox-style call frames, recursion/mutual recursion; `examples/fib.phg`
  runs on the VM.

## M1 — Tree-walking interpreter + transpiler — 2026-06-15 (`9da6e56`)
- Full pipeline: lexer → parser → type-checker → tree-walking evaluator.
- Phorge → PHP transpiler, round-trip-verified against real PHP.
- CLI: `phorge <run|check|parse|lex|transpile>`.
- Language surface: static types, immutable-by-default bindings, functions, classes + constructor
  promotion, single-payload enums + exhaustive `match`, string interpolation, `List<T>` literals,
  `for…in`, checked int/float arithmetic. 162 tests green at the tag.
