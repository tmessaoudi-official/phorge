//! AST → bytecode compiler (M2 P1–P3). A dedicated pass over the type-checked AST,
//! emitting a `Chunk` the VM executes. Mirrors the tree-walker's semantics so
//! `runvm` output is byte-identical to `run` (the differential oracle).
//!
//! P2 scope: `main`-only programs — literals, arithmetic, comparison, logical
//! short-circuit, unary, interpolation, `println`, list literals, locals, `if`/`else`,
//! `for…in`, blocks. P3 added user function calls + call frames + recursion (multi-function
//! compile → `BytecodeProgram`). P4a adds single-payload enums (`Variant(args)` construction)
//! and exhaustive `match` (lowered to scrutinee-spill + per-arm tag/literal tests + payload
//! re-extraction; decision P4-7). P4b adds classes: each constructor compiles to a synthetic
//! function (promoted-field `MakeInstance` + body with the instance in scope), `ClassName(args)`
//! resolves to a `Call` into it, and `obj.field` lowers to `GetField` (decisions P4-4/P4-5). P4c
//! adds methods + `this`: each method compiles to a function with the receiver at slot 0,
//! `obj.m(args)` lowers to `CallMethod` (runtime dispatch on the receiver's class), and `this` /
//! bare field reads resolve against the receiver (decision P4-6). The compiler now covers the full
//! M1 surface. Enums, instances, and lists are value-native `Value` (no heap; P4-1).
